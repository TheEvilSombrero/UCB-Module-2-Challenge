Module 2 Challenge
I have uploaded the VBA script file as a .bas as I could not figure out how else to export it - please let me know if this is the right format or if I need to change it to something else. I have also uploaded screenshots of the final outputs from this VBA script in each of the worksheets for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. These scresnshots have been named according to the year which the worksheet has data for.
